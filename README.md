### A C# .NET windows form application

This project was performed in a team of 5 students during the second semester of my internship.
The goal of the project was to create an warehouse and employee management tool for a made-up company. It includes very basic OOD principles, weak security, bad database 
querys and a lack of structure. 

Even though the level of development was very low during this project, there are some nice parts to look at, especially looking back and seeing how I improved over 2 years.
Something to look at: Automatic scheduling tool -> An algorithm created by me and 1 other teammate, which goal was to completely auto-generate a work schedule for the made-up
store.
